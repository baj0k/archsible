archsible - initially an ansible playbook for the post configuration process of my archlinux desktop.
This project was made mostly for educational purposes.

This playbook is designed to perform an initial configuration and hardening on a new archlinux desktop. Additional roles for the servers deployment are included in order to document and ease the process of reinstalling / migrating my personal infrastructure.
It is not a general post-install configuration script, the playbooks are configured to deploy my dotfiles and my builds of tools that I use and it may break things for you if used carelessly.
